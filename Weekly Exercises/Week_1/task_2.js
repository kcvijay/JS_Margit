//Evaluate the below:
//something! //
3 + "65" // 365 = number + string =  string
7 - "3" // 4 // number -  string = number
15 % 5 // 0 // remainder
5 % 15 // 
"Java" + "Script" //JavaScript
"Java" - "Script" //NaN
" " + " " // // "  "
" " + 0 // " 0" // String +  number  = string
true + true // true // 2
true + false //false // 1
false + true //false // 1
false - true //undefined // -1
3 - 4 // -1


//Evaluate the below comparisons:
4 >= 2 // true
6 === 2 // false
3 <= 1 // false
1 != 1 // false
"A" > "B" // false //The way strings are ordered is roughly alphabetic but not really what you’d expect to see in a dictionary: uppercase letters are always “less” than lowercase ones, so "Z" < "a", and nonalphabetic characters (!, -, and so on) are also included in the ordering. When comparing strings, JavaScript goes over the characters from left to right, comparing the Unicode codes one by one.
// Other similar operators are >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to), == (equal to), and != (not equal to).

"B" < "C" // true
"a" > "A" // true
"b" < "A" // false
true === false // false
true != true // false


// Make the string: 
// "Go To Helsinki Business College," they said. "It'll Will Be "Fun"," they said.
// by using the + sign:

// console.log()
console.log(`Go to Helsinki Business College," they said. "It'll Will be "Fun"," they said.`);
